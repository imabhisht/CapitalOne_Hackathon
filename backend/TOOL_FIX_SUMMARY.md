# Tool Integration Fix Summary

## Problem
The tools were not being called properly in the agent system. Users reported that tools weren't being invoked when they should have been.

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, the issue was found to be in several areas:

1. **Insufficient Tool Call Instructions**: The system prompts were not explicit enough about when and how to use tools
2. **Poor Tool Call Format**: The LLM wasn't reliably following the `TOOL_CALL:` format
3. **Inadequate Error Handling**: Tool call failures weren't being logged or handled properly
4. **Missing Tool Integration**: Some agents weren't properly configured with tools

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts
- **Weather Agent**: Added explicit instructions with examples for using `get_weather` and `get_location` tools
- **Financial Agent**: Added clear instructions for using the `calculate` tool with mathematical expressions
- **Organic Farming Agent**: Added tool support with weather and calculation capabilities

### 2. Improved Tool Calling Logic
- Enhanced regex pattern matching for tool calls
- Better parameter parsing and cleaning
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Improved tool result formatting

### 3. Better Tool Response Handling
- Added structured responses with emojis and formatting
- Contextual advice based on tool results
- Agricultural implications for weather data
- Financial analysis for calculations

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Created integration test suite (`test_tools_integration.py`)
- Verified tool registry functionality
- Tested individual agent tool usage
- Confirmed agent coordinator routing

## Results
✅ **Weather Agent**: Successfully calls weather tools and provides agricultural context
✅ **Financial Agent**: Properly performs calculations and provides financial analysis
✅ **Organic Farming Agent**: Integrates weather and calculation tools for farming advice
✅ **Tool Registry**: All tools (weather, calculator, location) working correctly
✅ **Agent Coordinator**: Proper routing to specialized agents

## Test Results
- **Tool Registry**: All 3 tools (`get_location`, `get_weather`, `calculate`) working
- **Weather Tool**: Successfully retrieves mock weather data
- **Calculator Tool**: Performs mathematical calculations correctly
- **Agent Integration**: All agents properly call their respective tools
- **Response Formatting**: Clean, structured responses with appropriate context

## Usage Examples

### Weather Queries
```
User: "What's the weather in Mumbai?"
Agent: Calls get_weather("Mumbai") and provides agricultural implications
```

### Financial Calculations
```
User: "Calculate 8% interest on $1000"
Agent: Calls calculate("1000 * 0.08") and provides financial analysis
```

### Farming Advice
```
User: "What's good for organic farming today?"
Agent: Calls get_weather() and provides organic farming recommendations
```

## Monitoring and Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the tool calling pipeline
- Tool execution success/failure tracking
- Parameter validation and error reporting
- Performance metrics for tool calls

The tools are now properly integrated and working as expected across all specialized agents.
